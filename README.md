# Digit-Rcognization-ExplanationOf-CNN-with-depth


If anyone need to work on this project, fork this and start working, if your solution is much better than mine than we can update here.
## WorkFlow:

 ==> You wonder how we use these images to predict by using Model? The Answer you will get is:

* First we load the data and check the data by visualizing it, because visualization will give us a clear picture of every single data it contain.
* Second one is that, we need to clean the data and cleaning the data means preprocessing the images that we have, I'll explain the preprocessing of the images.
* After preprocessing we do feature engineering but we are on basics, so we will not do this part.
* At last, we Create a Deep Learning Model from Scratch and train it and then validate some hidden part of the data, and also we predict the test data that we have by using our Deep Learning Model.


## Key concepts in a Neural Network

==> I explained the Key, Concepts of Convolutional Nueral Network, Here are the Concepts which I defined in my Notebook:

1. Neuron
2. Activation Functions
3. Forward Propagation
4. Error Computation
5. Backward Propagation

## DATASET:

The Dataset divides into two main parts which are Train Part and Test Part, we Use Train Part file named as train.csv and split it into 70-30% for training the model and validating the model. we try to analyze the performance of our Convolutional Nueral Network on Digit Recognization's Datset's validation part, we check it's recall and accuracy and try to do hyperparameter tuning to achieve better accuracy.  At Last after validation, then test the Convolutional Nueral Network Model (CNN) on Test data which are in Test rar file named test.csv. I added the link of train.csv and test.csv according to Kaggle's Kernel, If you are using other platform like Colab and other like Jupyter, Spyder.

TO DOWNLOAD THE DATA: I UPLOADED THE DATASETS OF TRAIN AND TEST.
