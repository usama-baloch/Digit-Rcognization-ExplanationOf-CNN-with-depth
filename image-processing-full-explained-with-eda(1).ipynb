If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.\n \n* Computer vision works much the same as human vision, except humans have a head start. Human sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart, how far away they are, whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image.\n \n* Computer vision trains machines to perform these functions, but it has to do it in much less time with cameras, data and algorithms rather than retinas, optic nerves and a visual cortex. Because a system trained to inspect products or watch a production asset can analyze thousands of products or processes a minute, noticing imperceptible defects or issues, it can quickly surpass human capabilities.\n\nLink: https://www.ibm.com/topics/computer-vision","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Interpretation:\n\nYou wonder how we use these images to predict by using Model?\nThe Answer you will get is:\n\n* First we load the data and check the data by visualizing it, because visualization will give us a clear picture of every single data it contain.\n* Second one is that, we need to clean the data and cleaning the data means preprocessing the images that we have. I'll explain the preprocessing of the images. So, don't worry :)\n* After preprocessing we do feature engineering but we are on basics, so we will not do this part.\n* At last, we Create a Deep Learning Model from Scratch and train it and then validate some hidden part of the data, and also we predict the test data that we have by using our Deep Learning Model.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nA Kernel by Siti Khodijah on image preprocessing where she explained the basics Preprocessing of Images very well explained and with great visualization, it will helps you alot, must check this out: [Image Preprocessing](https://www.kaggle.com/code/khotijahs1/cv-image-preprocessing)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Now, we first get to the theory of Image Processing:**\n\nImage processing could be simple tasks like image resizing.In order to feed a dataset of images to a convolutional network, they must all be the same size. Other processing tasks can take place like geometric and color transformation or converting color to grayscale and many more.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### **We use Convolutional Neural Network:**\n\nNeural networks are a type of machine learning models which are designed to operate similar to biological neurons and human nervous system. These models are used to recognize complex patterns and relationships that exists within a labelled dataset. They have following properties:\n\n* The core architecture of a Neural Network model is comprised of a large number of simple processing nodes called Neurons which are interconnected and organized in different layers.\n\n* An individual node in a layer is connected to several other nodes in the previous and the next layer. The inputs form one layer are received and processed to generate the output which is passed to the next layer.\n\n* The first layer of this architecture is often named as input layer which accepts the inputs, the last layer is named as the output layer which produces the output and every other layer between input and output layer is named is hidden layers.\n\n### **Key concepts in a Neural Network**\n\n#### 1. Neuron:\nA Neuron is a single processing unit of a Neural Network which are connected to different other neurons in the network. These connections repersents inputs and ouputs from a neuron. To each of its connections, the neuron assigns a ‚Äúweight‚Äù (W) which signifies the importance the input and adds a bias (b) term.\n\n#### 2. Activation Functions:\nThe activation functions are used to apply non-linear transformation on input to map it to output. The aim of activation functions is to predict the right class of the target variable based on the input combination of variables. Some of the popular activation functions are Relu, Sigmoid, and TanH.\n\n#### 3. Forward Propagation:\n\nNeural Network model goes through the process called forward propagation in which it passes the computed activation outputs in the forward direction.\n\nZ = W*X + b\nA = g(Z)\n\n* g is the activation function\n* A is the activation using the input\n* W is the weight associated with the input\n* B is the bias associated with the node\n\n#### 4. Error Computation:\nThe neural network learns by improving the values of weights and bias. The model computes the error in the predicted output in the final layer which is then used to make small adjustments the weights and bias. The adjustments are made such that the total error is minimized. Loss function measures the error in the final layer and cost function measures the total error of the network.\n\nLoss = Actual_Value - Predicted_Value\n\nCost = Summation (Loss)\n\n#### 5. Backward Propagation:\nNeural Network model undergoes the process called backpropagation in which the error is passed to backward layers so that those layers can also improve the associated values of weights and bias. It uses the algorithm called Gradient Descent in which the error is minimized and optimal values of weights and bias are obtained. This weights and bias adjustment is done by computing the derivative of error, derivative of weights, bias and subtracting them from the original values.\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class=\"alert alert-info\">  \n<h3><strong>Import
